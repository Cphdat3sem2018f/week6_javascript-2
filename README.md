You can do with NetBeans only for this period, but I (very much) suggest you install node and a new JavaScript editor, to prepare yourself for period 3 (and make this periods JavaScript a bit more fun/realistic)
- Install Node (important, install the LTS-version): https://nodejs.org/en/download/

- Install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) (if not already done) before wednesdays lecture (Ajax)

## Business competences

JavaScript is one of the most demanded programming skills (ref: [it.jobindex.dk](https://it.jobindex.dk/jobsoegning?q=javascript&supid=1) ).

JavaScript this semester will provide students with the background to join modern front-end teams, using JS and supplementing JS frameworks/libraries.
